  # At the moment, the web application relies on relative paths to invoke the backend service API.
  # However, the backend might not be present on the same environment, nor port as it is a external service.
  # To make the application more flexible, we are going to optionally include additional configurations/snippets that
  # will be added to the current config. These configurations can be used to proxy the requests that come out of the
  # web application and route them to the correct address of the backend service.
  #
  # Note that the additional configurations should be placed in specific sub-directory and start with specific prefix!
  # If there are no files, nothing will be included to the current configuration definition.
