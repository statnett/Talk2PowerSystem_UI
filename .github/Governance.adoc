= Project Governance

This document outlines the governance model for the project, defining roles, responsibilities, and branch management strategy.

== Roles and Permissions
The project follows a structured role-based access control model. The roles are defined as follows:

=== Read
- Can view repository contents and discussions.
- Can submit issues and comment on existing ones.
- No write access.

=== Triage
- Can label, categorize, and prioritize issues.
- Can assist in reviewing and managing issue reports.
- Cannot merge pull requests or modify the repository.

=== Write
- Can create and push branches.
- Can submit and review pull requests.
- Can update documentation and contribute code.
- Cannot modify project settings or manage permissions.

=== Maintain
- Can approve and merge pull requests.
- Responsible for reviewing and enforcing coding standards.
- Can manage project workflows and CI/CD configurations.
- Cannot delete the repository or change administrative settings.

=== Admin
- Full control over repository settings and permissions.
- Can manage roles and access levels.
- Can enforce security policies and branch protections.
- Responsible for repository governance and compliance.

== Branch Management Strategy

=== Default Branch
- The default working branch for active development is **`development`**.
- All new features and bug fixes must be merged into the **`development`** branch before being included in a release.

=== Historical Branches
- Versioning follows **Semantic Versioning** (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).
- Major and minor releases are archived as historical branches following the format:
  - `vX.Y` (e.g., `v1.0`, `v1.1`, `v2.0`)
- Patch releases are handled within the latest minor release branch.

=== Branch Protection Rules
- The **`development`** branch is protected and requires pull request reviews before merging.
- Historical branches are read-only to preserve past versions.
- Direct pushes to protected branches are restricted to **Maintain** and **Admin** roles.

== Decision-Making Process
- Governance decisions are made by the **Admin** role in consultation with **Maintain** members.
- Feature discussions, roadmaps, and major changes are discussed through issue tracking and proposal discussions.
- Voting or consensus-based decision-making is used for impactful changes.

== Amendments
This governance document may be updated as needed. Changes must be reviewed and approved by **Admin** before adoption.
