= User Interface (UI) for Talk to the Power System
v0.1.0-alpha, 2025-06-23
:toc:  
:toclevels: 2  

== Overview  

Talk2PowerSystem UI is the user interface for interacting with the Talk2PowerSystem platform. It simplifies access to complex power system models, knowledge graphs, and LLM-based semantic services.

This interface is tailored for:
- Energy professionals
- Domain experts
- Data scientists

It enables intuitive exploration and querying of CIM, CGMES, and BIM-aligned data.

== Features

* Natural Language Interface (NLI) for querying CIM Knowledge Graph.
* Knowledge Graph Explorer with filtering and semantic linking.
* Power System Model Visualization and navigation between World View (Frame and Models) and one or more substation as single-line diagram.
* Dataset, Catalogue, Profile and validation report browser with metadata view
* General TriG / JSON-LD / SPARQL Viewer
* ðŸ“¦ Modular Panels for:
** SHACL Validator (select validation engine)
** Profile Loader
** SchemaOps (Schema version comparison)
** ModelOps (Model/dataset version comparison)
** Simulation (primely for validation) Setup

== Tech Stack

*Frontend Framework:*:: (TBD) (e.g. React (TypeScript))
*UI Libraries:*:: (TBD) (e.g. TailwindCSS, ShadCN, Lucide Icons)
*Graph Visualization:*:: (TBD) (e.g. Recharts, D3.js, Cytoscape.js)
*Data Standards:*:: JSON-LD, TriG, CIM-XML, SPARQL
*API Layer:*:: REST and GraphQL (to Talk2PowerSystem Core)
